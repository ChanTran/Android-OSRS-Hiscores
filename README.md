# Android-OSRS-Hiscores
Android version of OSRS Hiscores, a port of my JFrame application that can be found [here](https://github.com/ChanTran/OSRS-Hiscores)

This program displays various information about a player's Oldschool Runescape profile. Features include looking up skills, progress, highscore, ranking, etc. Does not include ironman, deadman, clue scroll lookup at this time.

Also includes a notes database (basically just testing how a SQL Database works)

# How to download
